#### Be a Donor

One of the aims of the National Library is to build a comprehensive collection on Singapore and selectively on Southeast Asia. We welcome donations of published and unpublished works that will enrich our collection, but unfortunately are not able to accept everything.

To find out more about the donation process, and materials we are looking for in particular, <a href="https://www.nlb.gov.sg/GetInvolved/Donate/DonatetoourCollections.aspx" style="color:#E21216;">please click here</a>.
