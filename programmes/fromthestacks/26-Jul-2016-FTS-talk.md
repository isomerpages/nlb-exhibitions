Chinese identity and loyalty to home and country among the Chinese in 19th and 20th centuries evolved over time.

Join Professor Wang Gungwu, Chairman of the East Asian Institute and University Professor at the National University of Singapore, as he traces the shifts in identity and loyalty of the Chinese in Singapore from the 19th century to post independence in 1965.
