#### From Priest to an Islamic Reformer – The Life, Works and Legacy of Abdullah Bin Abdul Kadir Munsyi (1796-1854)

__Saturday, 7 May 2016, 2:30pm – 4:00pm__<br>
__Level 5, Imagination Room__

Find out more about the life, works, influences and legacy of Abdullah bin Abdul Kadir Munsyi (1796-1854), a prominent and controversial 19th century Malay writer.  Abdullah is widely regarded as the father of modern Malay-Indonesian literature and his works, especially his autobiography (_Hikayat Abdullah_, 1849) and travelogue (_Kisah Pelayaran Abdullah_, 1838), were promoted by both British and Dutch colonial institutions.  However, Abdullah’s pro-colonial stance was strongly criticized by some, with his own communities seeing him as a ‘British stooge’ and mocking him as ‘Abdullah Paderi’ (Abdullah the Priest). Only in the early 21st century was Abdullah regarded by scholars to be an Islamic Reformer. Join Dr Hadijah as she traces Abdullah’s legacy in Southeast Asia, Europe and the United States and sheds light on the man and his works.
