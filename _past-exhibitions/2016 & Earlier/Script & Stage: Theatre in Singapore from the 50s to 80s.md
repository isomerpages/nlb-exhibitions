<p>Script &amp; Stage explores the fascinating roots of local playwriting
and theatre production, highlighting significant performances, playwrights
and prominent theatre companies that have shaped the foundation of contemporary
theatre in Singapore.</p>
<p>As we trace the development of Singapore’s vernacular theatre communities
from the 1950s to the 1980s, treat yourself to publications such as <em>Keris Sempena Riau</em>,
the first <em>sandiwara</em> (Malay historical theatre) published and staged
locally, as well as the manuscripts and drafts of acclaimed local playwrights
like Kuo Pao Kun and Robert Yeo.</p>
<p>Not to be missed are showcases of notable local musicals, such as Beauty
World (TheatreWorks) and Chang and Eng (Action! Theatre), at the lobby
of the National Library Building.</p>
