#### Mapping Histories: Cartographic Representation of Singapore and Its Limits

__Saturday, 21 Mar, 2:00pm – 4:00pm &#124; Possibility Room, Level 5 &#124; Speaker: Dr Imran bin Tajudeen__

Maps record both cultural and natural physical data to varying degrees and a comparative perspective across time can reveal useful information about changes to multiple aspects of the landscape. In this session, Dr Imran, an assistant professor at the National University of Singapore’s Department of Architecture, will discuss the use of old maps to uncover the lesser-known aspects of place histories in Singapore.
