#### (Online) Histories: Biodiversity and Conservation in Singapore’s Fresh Waters

__24 May 2021__<br>
__6:00pm – 7:00pm__<br>
__Online event__

Singapore is home to a surprising variety of freshwater animal and plant species, found in habitats ranging from natural forest streams and freshwater swamps to urban reservoirs and canals. Yet, the island’s freshwater environments and associated biodiversity are in many ways different from what one might have encountered some 40 or even just 20 years ago. Find out more about Singapore’s freshwater biodiversity, including changes in its fauna and flora, from Darren C.J. Yeo, Deputy Head of the Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum. He will also touch on challenges facing some of our sensitive or threatened native freshwater species, as well as research and conservation efforts to protect them and their habitats.

### About the Speaker

Darren C.J. Yeo is the Deputy Head of the Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum, and an Associate Professor at the Department of Biological Sciences, National University of Singapore, where he leads the Freshwater and Invasion Biology Laboratory. His main research interests lie in freshwater ecology and biodiversity, aquatic invasions and freshwater crustaceans, which the laboratory investigates through studies of freshwater ecosystems in Singapore and other parts of tropical Asia.
