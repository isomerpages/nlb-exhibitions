First opened on 30 April 1970, Queenstown Public Library (then Queenstown Branch Library) was the first of several full-fledged public libraries built in the 1970s. These first-generation libraries made books more accessible to all Singaporeans at a time when many could not afford them.

Since then, our public libraries have gone through a dramatic transformation. Today, Singapore boasts of a National Library and 26 public libraries, which have evolved greatly from what they were decades ago.

Journey with us from the past to present in this interactive exhibition. Discover how much our public libraries have transformed and will continue to grow in the future!
