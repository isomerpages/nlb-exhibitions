#### Planning for Singapore: How Do We Do It?

__Saturday, 16 May, 2:00pm – 4:00pm &#124; Possibility Room, Level 5 &#124; Speaker: Mr Daniel Leong__

Given Singapore’s limited space and multiple land uses, the nation’s planners use a comprehensive framework that provides an integrated approach to sustainable development. Tools developed based on Geographic Information Systems (GIS) help to enhance and plan for the needs of the current and future generations of Singaporeans. Mr Daniel Leong, a planner with the Urban Redevelopment Authority, shares how these GIS tools can help to create a vibrant and sustainable city of distinction.

The programmes are limited to 120 participants per session, on a first-come-first-served basis.Admission is free.
