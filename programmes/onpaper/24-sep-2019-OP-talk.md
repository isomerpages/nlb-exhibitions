#### Southeast Asian Cosmopolitanism on its Own Terms: Banten as a Precolonial Model of a Southeast Asian Port-city

__24 Sep 2019__<br>
__7:00pm – 8:00pm__<br>
__Level 16, The Pod__

The economic success of Banten, a flourishing pre-colonial port-city in the north coast of Java, can be considered to be a result of its local understanding of pluralism and multiculturalism that was both pragmatic and realistic. 
 
Join Dr Farish Noor as he explores Banten’s cosmopolitan trading society and how documentary evidence gathered from the 17th century provides insight into the complexities of its society and interconnectedness to a wider trading network that extended across Asia.
