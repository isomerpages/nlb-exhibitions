<p>Donations of library materials to the National Library play a significant
role in adding diversity and depth to our collection and are instrumental
in assisting the library to obtain notable National Collection items. Over
the past 10 years, we have collected over 116,000 items contributed by
more than 425 donors.</p>
<p>Our donors comprise individuals (including collectors and scholars), families
and organisations. The types of materials donated include primary materials
such as diaries, personal papers, letters, business and organisational
documents, manuscripts of notable Singaporean writers and artists, photographs
and early maps of Singapore and the region.</p>
<p>This Donors’ Gallery was set up to acknowledge our donors and showcase
their donations. On display is a small selection of materials which provides
a glimpse of the variety of materials that have been gifted to the National
Library over the years.</p>
