<p>First opened on 30 April 1970, Queenstown Public Library (then Queenstown
Branch Library) was the first of several full-fledged public libraries
built in the 1970s. These first-generation libraries made books more accessible
to all Singaporeans at a time when many could not afford them.</p>
<p>Since then, our public libraries have gone through a dramatic transformation.
Today, Singapore boasts of a National Library and 26 public libraries,
which have evolved greatly from what they were decades ago. &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>Journey with us from the past to present in this interactive exhibition.
Discover how much our public libraries have transformed and will continue
to grow in the future!</p>
