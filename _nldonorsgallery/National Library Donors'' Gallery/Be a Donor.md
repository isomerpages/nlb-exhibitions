<h4>Be a Donor</h4>
<p>One of the aims of the National Library is to build a comprehensive collection
on Singapore and selectively on Southeast Asia. We welcome donations of
published and unpublished works that will enrich our collection, but unfortunately
are not able to accept everything.</p>
<p>To find out more about the donation process, and materials we are looking
for in particular, <a href="https://www.nlb.gov.sg/main/partner-us/Donate-to-our-Collections" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">please click here</a>.</p>
