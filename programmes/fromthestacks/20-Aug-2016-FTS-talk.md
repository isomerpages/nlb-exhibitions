#### Picturing the Past: 19th-century Photographs of Singapore

__Saturday, 20 Aug 2016, 2:30pm – 3:30pm__<br>
__Level 5, Imagination Room__

In the days before easy amateur photography and picture postcards, travellers had to purchase large-format topographical views supplied by professional photographic firms. As a transportation hub and busy port city, Singapore was home to several such firms from the 1860s. Today these remarkable images are prized as important records of the island’s rapidly changing landscape.  In her illustrated talk, writer Gretchen Liu will introduce the main photographers on the scene then and discuss their contributions to Singapore’s visual heritage.

##### Speaker
__Gretchen Liu__ is a former journalist and book editor with a keen interest in Singapore’s visual heritage. She is the author of several illustrated books relating to Singapore history and architecture including A Pictorial History of Singapore 1819-2000.
