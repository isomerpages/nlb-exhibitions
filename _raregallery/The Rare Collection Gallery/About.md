<p>The Rare Collection Gallery showcases treasures from the National Library's
Rare Materials Collection of valuable research materials on Singapore and
Southeast Asia. Comprising over 15,000 books, journals, manuscripts, maps,
photographs and ephemera, many of the items in the collection were inherited
from the National Library's predecessors — the Singapore Library (1844
– 1874) and the Raffles Museum and Library (1874 – 1960). The collection
is also further enhanced by recent donations from institutions and individuals.
The items on display are regularly refreshed to highlight the various interesting
artefacts from the Rare Materials Collection, and is open for viewing during
organised public tours.</p>
