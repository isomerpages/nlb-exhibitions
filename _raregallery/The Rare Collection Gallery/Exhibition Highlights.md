<h3><strong><em>The Substance of Our Saviour's Sermon on the Mount Contained in the 5th, 6th &amp; c.7th Chapters of the Gospel According to St. Matthew</em></strong></h3>
<p>Singapore: Printed by the S. C. Mission Press, 1829&nbsp;</p>
<p>Collection of National Library, Singapore&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>This booklet, one of 500 copies printed in 1829, is the oldest item featured
in the display. It is a Malay translation of the Sermon on the Mount, one
of the most significant and well-known teachings of Jesus from the Gospel
of Matthew in the Bible. The printing and distribution of religious literature
in local languages was an important part of missionary work in the region.
This title was likely translated by Danish missionary Claudius Henry Thomsen
from the London Missionary Society, as he had translated the Gospel of
Matthew in 1821 under the tutelage of his Malay teacher, Munshi Abdullah
Abdul Kadir, in Melaka. Thomsen is credited for establishing the first
printing press in Singapore, the Mission Press, in 1823.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong><em>Inilah Syaer Panji Semirang: Cerita Tanah Jawa &nbsp;</em></strong>&nbsp;</h3>
<p>[c. 1886]&nbsp;</p>
<p>Collection of National Library, Singapore&nbsp;</p>
<p>This <em>syair</em> is based on the <em>Panji</em> tales from Java. <em>Panji</em> is
the name of legendary Javanese prince who goes in search of his beloved,
Princess <em>Candra Kirana</em>. A typical <em>Panji</em> tale contains many
adventures, with both the hero and heroine adopting various disguises and
new names. In this story, <em>Candra Kirana</em> disguises herself as a man
named <em>Panji Semirang</em>. Originating from East Java probably around
the 13th century, Panji tales have been translated into several Southeast
Asian languages, thus influencing the oral and written traditions, as well
as performing arts of the region. It has also been made into a movie. Commonly
called Panji tales, they are a unique example of a local literary tale
that has spread throughout Southeast Asia, with each country developing
its own cultural version. This book of verse is based on the Malay translation
of the Javanese tale and was originally re-written as <em>hikayat, </em>circa
early 15th century.<em>&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong><em>Cermin Mata Bagi Segala Orang Yang Menuntut Pengetahuan [Eye Glass for All Who Seek Knowledge]&nbsp;</em></strong>&nbsp;</h3>
<p>[1859]&nbsp;</p>
<p>Collection of National Library, Singapore&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Cermin Mata </em>is one of the first Malay journals to be published
in Singapore, and among the earliest Malay works to be printed using lithography.
It was compiled and printed by Reverend Benjamin Keasberry, most likely
with the help of Munshi Abdullah bin Abdul Kadir. <em>Cermin Mata</em> was
used as an educational material in missionary schools and contained a mixture
of Christian tracts, general knowledge and original writings of Munshi
Abdullah. Keasberry is known for advancing the use of lithography, which
allowed the printing of text that resembled the flow of the handwritten
script. His success influenced the local Malay commercial presses to adopt
the new technology (which was less costly than typography), leading to
a gradual transition from manuscript copying to printing.&nbsp;</p>
