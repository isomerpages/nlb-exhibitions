The first edition of William Shakespeare’s collected plays was published in 1623. This is commonly known as the First Folio and is one of the most iconic and valuable books in the world. In “Comedies, Histories and Tragedies”, Richard Ovenden, Bodley’s Librarian, will be joined by Professor Rhodri Lewis from the University of Oxford to explain why the First Folio matters. They will discuss the history of the Bodleian Library’s two copies of the First Folio and, using Hamlet as a guide, explain how the Folio helps us understand Shakespearean drama.
