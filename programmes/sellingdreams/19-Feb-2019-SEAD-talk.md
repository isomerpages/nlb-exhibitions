It is generally thought that Japanese products and services were only present in Singapore from the 1940s onwards. However, there is evidence of Japanese brand presence in Singapore’s “Little Japan” (spanning Hylam, Malabar and Malay streets) from as early as the 19th century. Advertisements from the 1830s to 1930s publicising Japanese curios, stores, dentists, photographers, hotels, masseuses and even a fishing pond all point to the presence of Japanese products and services in early Singapore.

Join Peter Ling as he shares part of his fascinating research on Japanese advertising in Singapore between the 19th and 21st centuries.
