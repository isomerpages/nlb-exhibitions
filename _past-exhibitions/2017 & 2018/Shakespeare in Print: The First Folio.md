<p>Join us at the National Library as we showcase Shakespeare’s First Folio,
first printed in 1623, on special loan from The University of Oxford’s
Bodleian Libraries for six weeks only. Shakespeare’s plays are among the
most significant pieces of literature in the English language and have
influenced art and media all over the world for centuries.</p>
<p>Shakespeare in Print: The First Folio is an exciting opportunity for you
to see Shakespeare’s plays in their first printed form. Without it and
the efforts of its publishers to preserve Shakespeare’s works, plays such
as Antony and Cleopatra, The Tempest, and Macbeth would have been lost.
What’s more, you will also learn about the impact of Shakespeare’s works
on theatre in Asia as well as his influence on our modern-day use of the
English language.</p>
