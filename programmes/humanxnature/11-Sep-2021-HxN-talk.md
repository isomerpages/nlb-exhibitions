#### (Online) Histories: Beyond the City in Nature – Stories from the Orang Seletar

__11 September 2021__<br>
__2:00pm – 3:00pm__<br>
__Online event__

The Orang Seletar are one of the last “living” communities of sea people, or Orang Laut, of the Singapore and Malaysian waters. For them, nature does not serve just their daily needs, such as food and medicine. From childbirth rituals to the construction of houseboats, to matters involving the unseen world, their ancestral knowledge and cultural traditions often reflect their symbiotic relationship with their physical environment.

Join independent researchers Chan Kah Mei and Ilya Katrinnada as they share their insights and experiences from conducting oral history interviews with the Orang Seletar community currently residing in Johor Bahru, Malaysia, offering a glimpse of the lives and memories of one of our nation’s indigenous populations.
