#### TEMASEK AND SINGAPURA: Marvels, Metaphors and Meanings from Sejarah Melayu

__23 February 2019__<br>
__2:00pm – 5:00pm__<br>
__Level 16, The POD, National Library Building__

_Conducted in English._

Sejarah Melayu is considered one of the most important and finest literary works of the Malay world. Essentially a court text that recorded the dynastic and feudal glories of Palembang-Singapura-Melaka and Johore from the 13th to 16th centuries, this text has piqued the interests of historians, academics as well as politicians in the era of nationalism and post-independence.

This symposium aims to highlight Sejarah Melayu and its effects on the cultural and literary history of Singapore and beyond.
