<p>We all grew up with the story of Sang Nila Utama and how he founded Singapura,
the “lion city”. This tale from the 13th century is included in one of
the oldest and most important Malay texts, Sulalat al-Salatin, which was
actually composed four centuries later, around the 17th century.</p>
<p>Sulalat-al-Salatin, or more commonly known as Sejarah Melayu (Malay Annals),
contains tales that not only underline Singapore’s significance as one
of the capital cities of Malay kings since the 13th century; it is also
one of the few surviving materials that describe the early history of Singapore.</p>
<p>With many tales such as the strong man Badang and the attack of the garfish,
Sejarah Melayu continues to enchant writers and readers everywhere. Discover
these timeless stories and how one man managed to bring this ancient manuscript
to the masses, thereby ensuring that its legacy live on through the ages.</p>
