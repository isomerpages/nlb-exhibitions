<p>Maps are fascinating objects; they not only tell us about the places they
depict but also how their makers saw the world around them. For Singapore
in particular, maps are a window to our early history – before the arrival
of the British in 1819. The National Library is pleased to present Geo|Graphic,
an offering of exhibitions and programmes that explore maps and mapping.</p>

<p>In this work titled Bibliotopia, Michael Lee uses the device of the mind
map to uncover the “secret bookscape” of Singapore’s book culture. Focusing
on the genres of short fiction, horror and the teen novel through the literary
output of Catherine Lim, Russell Lee and Adrian Tan – the artist draws
out secrets that are hidden within, or exposed by, narratives on identity,
adolescence, and the ghostly in Singapore.</p><pre><code>    &lt;p&gt;Michael Lee is an artist, curator and publisher, whose works focus on urban memory and fiction, with an emphasis on their contexts and issues of loss.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>In the installation Outliers by Jeremy Sharma, are four white polystyrene
blocks with undulating surfaces that capture the signals of dying stars
(pulsars) in material form. Sharma, with the help of a pulsar scientist,

<p>Asia, particularly Southeast Asia, had a strong hold over the imaginations
of early Europeans as a source of gold, spices and all things exotic. Land
of Gold and Spices presents a fascinating look at how Southeast Asia was
perceived, conceived of and mapped by the Europeans from the 15th to the
early 19th centuries.</p><pre><code>    &lt;p&gt;The maps featured in this exhibition are from the National Library, Singapore’s rare maps collection and tell stories of the European presence in the region. The exhibition features printed and hand-drawn maps as well as sailing instructions that point to Singapore’s early history before the arrival of the British in 1819. On special loan from European libraries are rare maps, such as indigenous Southeast Asian maps, on display for the very first time in Singapore.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Part of the SEA STATE series, <strong>SEABOOK</strong> follows Charles Lim’s

materials, anecdotes and memories that unravels Singapore’s relationship
with the sea. Developed with the librarians from the National Library,
the project attempts to highlight the range of primary resources available
on the sea from the colonial and post-colonial periods. In effect, SEABOOK
aspires to be the most extensive cultural study of Singapore’s troubled
relationship with the sea.</p><pre><code>    &lt;p&gt;Charles Lim will represent Singapore in the 2015 Venice Biennale. He has a close relationship with the sea, being a former national sailor and having represented Singapore in the 1996 Olympics.&lt;/p&gt;
