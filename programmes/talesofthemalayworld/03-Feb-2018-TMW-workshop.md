#### I Can Compose and Recite Syair!

__Saturday, 3 February 2018__<br>
__9:30am – 11:00am__<br>
__Level 5, Imagination Room__<br>
__Facilitators: Dr Sa’eda Buang and Dr Kartini Anwar__<br>
_This workshop will be conducted in English and Malay. Participants must understand and be able to speak simple Malay._

Syair is a form of traditional Malay poetry that is made up of quatrains. Unlike another poetic form, _pantun_, each line of every stanza in _syair_ contributes to the formation of a unified idea or story.

Participants will be introduced to the functions and basic features of _syair_. They will also encounter various melodious forms of _syair_ recitations based on the content and intent of the _syair_. Look forward to composing at least two verses of _syair_ and reciting them!
