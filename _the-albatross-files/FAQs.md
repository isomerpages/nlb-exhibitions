<h4><strong>[Pre-launch] <em>The Albatross File</em> Exhibition Website FAQs</strong></h4>
<p><em>Excludes information on ticketing and visit preparation, which will be released alongside the ticketing platform in mid-Nov.</em>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the Albatross File, and what is this exhibition?</strong>
<br>The Albatross File was kept by Dr Goh Keng Swee in the run-up to Singapore’s
separation from Malaysia. It contains Cabinet papers, memorandums, as well
as Dr Goh’s handwritten notes of his discussions with Malaysian leaders
in the days, weeks, and months leading to 9 August 1965.</p>
<p>A book on the Albatross File will be launched alongside this SG60 Capstone
event, the introspective exhibition, called <strong><em>The Albatross File: Singapore’s Separation Declassified</em></strong>,
on 7 December 2025 at the National Library. Jointly organised by the National
Library Board and the Ministry of Digital Development and Information,
this permanent exhibition will deepen visitors’ understanding of Singapore’s
journey to independence through interactive storytelling, historical replays,
and first-person narratives of Singapore’s founding fathers. As Singapore
celebrates SG60, the book and exhibition offer an introspective recount
of Singapore’s separation from Malaysia, deepening our collective appreciation
of Singapore’s shared identity and inspiring future generations to continue
building our nation together.</p>
<p><strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How do we visit the Albatross File exhibition?&nbsp;</strong>
<br>Open to the public from 8 December 2025, <strong><em>The Albatross File: Singapore’s Separation Declassified</em></strong> is
a permanent exhibition held at Level 10 of the National Library Building.
Admission is free, but will require tickets. Visitors will be able to book
free tickets to the exhibition later this year.</p>
<p>Interested individuals may sign up for our <a href="https://go.gov.sg/albatrossmailinglist" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">mailing list</a> to receive
updates on when the tickets are available.</p>
<p><strong>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this exhibition suitable for families?</strong>
<br>While open to all, for an optimal experience, this exhibition is recommended
for individuals aged 10 years old and above. The exhibition provides a
unique opportunity for families – children, parents, and grandparents –
to explore Singapore’s formative years together.</p>
<p><strong>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will the exhibition be in four languages?</strong>
<br>The exhibition is in English. Exhibition guides will be made digitally
available in Singapore’s four official languages: Malay, Chinese, Tamil
and English.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>How different is the Albatross File book and exhibition to CNA's earlier documentary on the same topic?</strong>
<br>CNA’s documentary relied, for the most part, on British and Australian
documents declassified up to 35 or more years ago. These documents were
also relied upon by Mr Lee Kuan Yew in his autobiography <em>The Singapore Story</em> as
well as Professor Albert Lau’s definitive account of Separation, <em>The Moment of Anguish</em>.
Both books were published in 1998.</p>
<p>The Albatross File book and exhibition tell the story from our point of
view – and will include a larger set of documents that have been declassified
from the Albatross File, such as handwritten notes of Dr Goh Keng Swee
and Mr Lee Kuan Yew, Cabinet papers which discuss the policy deliberations
behind separation, as well as extracts of oral histories of Dr Goh Keng
Swee, Mr Ong Pang Boon, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, and Mrs Lee Kuan Yew, which have
not been made public until now.</p>
