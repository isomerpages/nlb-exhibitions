#### (Online) Histories: Singapore’s Climate in the Past, Present and Future

__13 July 2021__<br>
__6:00pm – 7:00pm__<br>
__Online event__

Singapore’s climate is changing. We can expect it to continue evolving in the future with anthropogenic climate change and a changing urban landscape. With more frequent and intense extreme temperature and rainfall events as well as sea level rise projected in the future , we can expect the environment we live in to change dramatically and for these changes to have knock-on effects on our lives.

Find out more from Raizan Rahmat, Deputy Director at the Meteorological Service Singapore (MSS), about what drives Singapore’s climate, how it has evolved and is projected to change in the future. He will also discuss some of the research activities undertaken at MSS to get a good grasp of the changing climate, the challenges in generating future climate scenarios, and how it fits into downstream adaptation studies.

### About the Speaker

Raizan Rahmat is the Deputy Director at the Meteorological Service Singapore (MSS) in the Weather Services Division where he leads a team of meteorological officers to research and develop products and services for the agency’s stakeholders. Prior to the recent switch to the current Department, Raizan was in the research arm of MSS, the Centre for Climate Research Singapore (CCRS), where he conducted research in local and regional climate patterns and, together with colleagues at CCRS, delivered Singapore’s Second National Climate Change Study.
