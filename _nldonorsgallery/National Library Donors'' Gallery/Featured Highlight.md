<h4>Singapore’s Urban Built Heritage</h4>
<p><strong>Through the Lens of Lee Kip Lin</strong>
</p>
<p>Lee Kip Lin (1925 – 2011) was a well-known architectural historian, educator
and architect. An advocate of conservation, he undertook extensive photographic
surveys of streets and buildings in Singapore from 1965 to 1995. The Lee
Kip Lin Collection, containing over 17,000 images, is a meticulous visual
record of Sinagapore’s architectural heritage and spatial transformation
over a 30-year period. The Lee family donated the photographs to the National
Library Board in 2009.</p>
<p>This display highlights Lee’s efforts in documenting the diverse architecture
and streetscapes of Singapore. The photographs capture the oldest urban
areas of Singapore – Boat Quay, Chinatown, Kampong Glam and Little India.
These four areas were the first to be gazetted for conservation by the
Urban Redevelopment Authority on 7 July 1989, which saw strict conservation
guidelines put in place to preserve the physical character of these historic
districts. While Lee’s primary focus was on the built form, his photographs
also serve as a record of the social life and economic activities in these
areas.</p>
