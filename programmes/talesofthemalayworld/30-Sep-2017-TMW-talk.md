<h4>The Script State (Negeri Naskhah) – Malay Manuscripts in Documenting Memories</h4>

__Saturday, 30 September 2017__<br>
__3:00pm – 4:00pm__<br>
__Level 5, Possibility Room__<br>
__Speaker: Dr Azhar Ibrahim__<br>
_This talk is conducted in English_

Manuscripts are testaments of their time, as they reflect the conditions and people surrounding the text. Today, the reception of manuscripts and texts – the way we read and interpret them – is also subject to the prevailing ideas of our time.

This programme provides an overview of the written tradition of the Malay world, which we have inherited in the form of manuscripts. Discover the stories of these texts; their various forms throughout history; and how the written text has become a symbol of power, intellect and mastery. 

##### Speaker
__Azhar Ibrahim__ is a lecturer at the Department of Malay Studies, National University of Singapore. His research interests include sociology of religion, sociology of literature and critical literacy, and the Malay-Indonesia intellectual development.
