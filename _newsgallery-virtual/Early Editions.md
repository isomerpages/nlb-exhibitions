<p>First published on 8 October 1835, the <em>Singapore Free Press</em> was
named to mark the abolishment of the gagging act. It was founded by four
prominent British residents: William Napier, a lawyer and the paper’s main
owner; George D. Coleman, the first superintendent of public works; merchants
Edward Boustead and Walter Scott Lorrain. The newspaper ceased publication
in 1869 but was revived in 1884. <em>The Straits Times</em> eventually acquired
it in 1946.</p>

<p><em>Utusan Melayu</em> began publication on 29 May 1939 as a Malay daily
in Jawi script. It was the first Malay newspaper to be wholly owned, financed
and written by Malays. Before&nbsp;that, Malay newspapers were controlled
by Muslims of&nbsp;Arab&nbsp;and Indian origins. The first Malay-language
newspaper, <em>Jawi Peranakkan</em>, was owned by Indian Muslims. <em>Warta Malaya</em>,
another early leading paper, was owned by the Alsagoffs, an Arab family.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Yusof bin Ishak, who later became Singapore’s first Malayan-born&nbsp;Yang
di-Pertuan Negara&nbsp;(Head of State) and subsequently president, was
one of the newspaper’s prime movers.</p>

<p>First published on 6 September 1923, <em>Nanyang Siang Pau</em> was established
by businessman and philanthropist Tan Kah Kee to promote commerce and education.
With strong financial backing and experienced staff, the newspaper became
one of the leading dailies in Singapore.</p>
<p></p>
<p>On 16 March 1983, <em>Nanyang Siang Pau</em> merged with <em>Sin Chew Jit Poh</em> (星洲日报),
another leading daily, to form <em>Nanyang Xingzhou Lianhe Zaobao</em> (南洋星洲联合早报，later
shortened to Lianhe Zaobao) and its evening edition, <em>Lianhe Wanbao</em> (联合晚报).</p>

<p><em>Tamil Murasu</em> was first published on 6 July 1935 to propagate socio-economic
reforms carried out by the Tamil Reform Association, one of the earliest
Tamil associations in Singapore. In 1936, the association gave up the paper
due to financial losses and sold it to G. Sarangapany, who became its editor
and sole proprietor until his death in 1974. In 1995, the paper became
part of the Singapore Press Holdings (SPH) group, and continues as a daily
today.</p>
