<h4><strong>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) about <em>The Albatross File: Singapore’s Independence Declassified</em></strong></h4>
<p><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the Albatross File, and what is this exhibition?</strong>
<br>The Albatross File was kept by Dr Goh Keng Swee in the run-up to Singapore’s
separation from Malaysia. It contains Cabinet papers, memorandums, as well
as Dr Goh’s handwritten notes of his discussions with Malaysian leaders
in the days, weeks, and months leading to Singapore’s independence on 9
August 1965.</p>
<p><em>The Albatross File: Inside Separation</em> book and <em>The Albatross File: Singapore’s Independence Declassified</em> exhibition
will be launched on 7 December 2025 at the National Library Building.</p>
<p>Jointly organised by the National Library Board and the Ministry of Digital
Development and Information, this permanent exhibition, as the SG60 capstone
event, will deepen visitors’ understanding of Singapore’s journey to independence
through interactive storytelling, historical replays, and first-person
narratives of Singapore’s founding fathers. As Singapore celebrates SG60,
the book and exhibition offer an introspective recount of Singapore’s separation
from Malaysia, deepening our collective appreciation of Singapore’s shared
identity and inspiring future generations to continue building our nation
together.</p>
