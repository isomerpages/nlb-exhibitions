#### A Printmaker’s Tale

__Saturday, 25 Jun 2016, 2:30pm – 4:00pm__<br>
__Level 5, Possibility Room__

In this interactive session, artist and educator, Lim Bee Ling, will share with audiences different printmaking techniques through the ages. She will also showcase various matrixes and prints. Participants will get the chance to see these various print mediums up close.

##### Speaker
__Lim Bee Ling__ is a lecturer from the School of Fine Arts at LASALLE College of the Arts. Bee Ling has been practicing printmaking as a major art form. Her works deal with the notion of physical space as a medium of collective memory through the material and method she works with. She approaches this topic by manipulating the different printing principles in art-making, using archived images which are rooted in the memory of national identity.
