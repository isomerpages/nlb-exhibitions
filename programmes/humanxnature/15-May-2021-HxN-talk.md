#### (Online) Nature, Biodiversity and Our Role | WWF Explains

__15 May 2021__<br>
__2:00pm – 3:30pm__<br>
__Online event__

We depend on Nature for our survival. but Nature is in decline, and we are the cause for this decline. The challenges of nature loss and global warming are linked but so are their solutions. Nature-based solutions for climate harness the power of nature to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and also help us adapt to the impacts of climate change. They are win-win solutions that involve protecting, restoring and sustainably managing ecosystems to address society's challenges and promote human well-being. Join us to learn how we can restore nature by taking action for biodiversity.
