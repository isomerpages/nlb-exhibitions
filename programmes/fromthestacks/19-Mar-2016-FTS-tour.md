Within the National Library’s exhibition From the Stacks, is a beautifully illustrated series of books titled Birds of the Malay Peninsula that date as far back as 1927. Published by the earliest ornithologists in Singapore, Frederick Chasen and Herbert Robinson, the book details hundreds of bird species found in Malaya up to 1976.

In the spirit of exploration, join us for a fascinating walk around Labrador Park to identify and observe birds in their natural habitat.
