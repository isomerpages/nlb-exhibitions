#### (Online) Histories: Tracking Otters in Singapore

__17 March 2021__<br>
__6:00pm – 7:00pm__<br>
__Online event__

Urged to study a furry mammal in his beloved mangroves, Sivasothi a.k.a “Otterman” began by going through all the available research on otters in Singapore and Malaysia. This includes archived books and journals, museum collections and seeking answers from veteran naturalists, curators, librarians and scientists.

When otters first returned to Singapore, it was recreational coastal users who helped him track otter radiation. Two decades later, a network of otter-watchers now help Sivasothi understand the behaviour, dispersal and travails of otters in urbanised Singapore. These stories, which are shared in social media posts and scientific publications help repay that debt of information provided so generously given to Sivasothi from around the world three decades ago.

### About the Speaker

N. Sivasothi a.k.a. “Otterman” has been immersed in mangroves and wildlife for research, education and conservation at the National University of Singapore from the late 1980s onwards. He not only promotes public education, youth development and environmental stewardship in Singapore, he also contributes to wildlife working groups and close-door engagements to mitigate development impact.
