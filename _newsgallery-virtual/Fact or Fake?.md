<p>Fake news has become a global threat as it spreads like wildfire on the
Internet and social media. One’s ability to distinguish between facts and
falsehoods has never been more important.</p>
<p>Watch the video below to take part in the “Real or Fake?” game show, and
learn how to be more discerning with information from four cases of fake
news.</p>

<p>India is home to the highest number of WhatsApp users globally, with 200
million accounts and more than 13 billion messages sent daily on the Facebook-owned
app. Some users in rural India shared warnings with their WhatsApp contacts
to be wary of strangers in their midst, calling them criminals. Most among
these strangers – beggars and labourers – were innocent. Mistakenly identified
as child abductors or organ traffickers, many of them ended up being attacked
by villagers who believed these false warnings.</p>
<p>Since 2012, India has seen 132 such incidents of lynching (killing someone
without a legal trial), leaving 47 dead and 337 injured. As part of its
anti-fake news drive, Facebook curbed the reach of WhatsApp messages by
restricting the forwarding of a message to no more than five recipients.
In southern India’s Telangana state, the police also launched a public
education campaign to combat fake news among villagers.</p>
<h5>Lessons learnt:</h5>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Fake news that preys on people’s fears, like harm to self and family members,
can trigger aggressive behaviour such as mob lynching in this case. It
is important to treat such warnings with caution and verify them before
taking action.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Technology is a double-edged sword – it can enable the spread of fake
news, as well as curtail it.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Visual cues appeal more strongly to the mind than text, so misrepresented
images can be a powerful medium for falsehoods.</p>
<p>On 11 November 2016, a photograph purportedly showing the top floors of
a Housing &amp; Development Board (HDB) block in Punggol that had caved
in went viral. An alternative news site published the image with an alarming
headline: “This just happened! The top floors of Punggol Waterway Terraces
collapsed!” The HDB, among other agencies, immediately carried out checks
and assured the public that the building was safe. HDB also posted on its
Facebook page that the news was an “online hoax”.</p>
<p>It turned out that the website’s photograph of the flat had been taken
from an angle that played tricks on the eye. The false report was deleted
half an hour after being published.</p>
<h5>Lessons learnt:</h5>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Fake news can result in a lot of wasted time, effort and resources, especially
for cases involving public safety concerns, not to mention the anxiety
it induces in the public.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Image-based fake news that grabs your attention is rampant. Don’t believe
everything you see. Always verify suspicious images by using online tools
such as reverse image search</p>
</li>
</ul>
