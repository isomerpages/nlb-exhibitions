#### In Honour of Dead Friends: The Ethics of Antiquarian Book Collecting

__Thursday, 18 Feb 2016, 7:00pm â€“ 9:00pm &#124; Level 16, The Pod__

Books are the repositories of ideas and world views of those who have come before us, offering a glimpse into other life-worlds that in turn present us with alternative ways of understanding our world. Book collectors, therefore, play an essential role in preserving our published heritage.

Join Dr Farish A. Noor as he shares his 30-year journey of collecting antiquarian books and maps related to Southeast Asia.

##### Speaker
