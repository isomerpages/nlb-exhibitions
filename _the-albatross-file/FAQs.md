<h4><strong>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) about <em>The Albatross File: Singapore’s Independence Declassified</em></strong></h4>
<p><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the Albatross File, and what is this exhibition?</strong>
<br>The Albatross File was kept by Dr Goh Keng Swee in the run-up to Singapore’s
separation from Malaysia. It contains Cabinet papers, memorandums, as well
as Dr Goh’s handwritten notes of his discussions with Malaysian leaders
in the days, weeks, and months leading to 9 August 1965.</p>
<p>A book on the Albatross File will be launched alongside this SG60 Capstone
event, the introspective exhibition, called <em>The Albatross File: Singapore’s Independence Declassified</em>,
on 7 December 2025 at the National Library. Jointly organised by NLB and
the Ministry of Digital Development and Information, this permanent exhibition
will deepen visitors’ understanding of Singapore’s journey to independence
through interactive storytelling, historical replays, and first-person
narratives of Singapore’s founding fathers. As Singapore celebrates SG60,
the book and exhibition offer an introspective recount of Singapore’s separation
from Malaysia, deepening our collective appreciation of Singapore’s shared
identity and inspiring future generations to continue building our nation
together.</p>
