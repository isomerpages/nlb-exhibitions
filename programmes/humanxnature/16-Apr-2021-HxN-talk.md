#### (Online) Histories: Investigating Land Use History

__16 April 2021__<br>
__6:00pm – 7:00pm__<br>
__Online event__

As an environmental consultant, Tony O’Dempsey conducts fieldwork, research and analysis to characterise habitats and identify the species present. Collections, such as maps and aerial photographs, from the National Archives of Singapore (NAS), provide some historical perspectives of how past land uses have impacted the development of forest habitat after the land has been vacated. The work sometimes takes on a life of its own, branching into research on significant figures of our past.
