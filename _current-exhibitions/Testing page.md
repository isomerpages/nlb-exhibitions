The Bras Basah Bugis precinct was once home to many iconic schools, bookshops and libraries. Embark on a journey through the neighbourhood's storied past in this immersive projection with Augmented Reality (AR).

Inspired by [Curiocity](https://curiocity.nlb.gov.sg/) (an NLB website for stories about places in Singapore), this installation showcases the area's rich history through a nine-minute time-lapse projection across three eras.

Watch the landscape evolve from pre-war days to the present, and catch the way of life progress from man-pulled rickshaws to automated vehicles. Dive deeper as selected landmarks spring to life with AR points, revealing fun facts and literary treasures behind the book havens of Bras Basah!
