Product advertisements, in essence, are created to offer consumers choices. They persuade us to give ourselves a chance to transform ourselves – and our lives – for the better, through the simple act of choosing to purchase something. The addiction to buying and consumption leads to consumerism as a means to obtain a better life by way of capitalism.

But what lay beneath consumerism in the early settlement of Singapore? In this dialogue, Olivia will share about the significance of the images and text behind the design of print advertisements from early Singapore.
