#### Lithography and the Malay Manuscript Tradition

__Saturday, 24 February 2018__<br>
__11:00am – 12:00pm__<br>
__Level 5, Possibility Room__<br>
__Speaker: Prof Edwin P. Wieringa__<br>
_This talk will be conducted in English_

The technique of lithography enabled the Malay manuscript tradition to continue in the modern age, allowing for mass-produced printed texts. The Syair Unggas Bersoal-Jawab (Poem of the Debating Birds) is among the 10 most frequently reissued titles of Singapore Malay Muslim printing in the second half of the 19th century.

Join Prof. Edwin P. Wieringa as he discusses this once-popular Malay poem, which in scholarly literature has been dismissed as a poor and pale reflection of Attar’s world-famous 12th-century Persian Conference of the Birds. 

##### Speaker
__Edwin P. Wieringa__ is Professor of Indonesian Philology with Special Reference to Islamic Cultures at the University of Cologne, Germany.
