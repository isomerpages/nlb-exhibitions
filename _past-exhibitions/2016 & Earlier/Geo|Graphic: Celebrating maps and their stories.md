<p>Maps are fascinating objects; they not only tell us about the places they
depict but also how their makers saw the world around them. For Singapore
in particular, maps are a window to our early history – before the arrival
of the British in 1819. The National Library is pleased to present Geo|Graphic,
an offering of exhibitions and programmes that explore maps and mapping.</p>

<h6>Michael Lee<br>Work in progress for not here, not there (after Russell Lee) from the Bibliotopia series (2015)</h6>
<h3><strong>Bibliotopia</strong> | by Michael Lee</h3>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Level 7, Promenade, National Library Building</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In this work titled Bibliotopia, Michael Lee uses the device of the mind
map to uncover the “secret bookscape” of Singapore’s book culture. Focusing
on the genres of short fiction, horror and the teen novel through the literary
output of Catherine Lim, Russell Lee and Adrian Tan – the artist draws
out secrets that are hidden within, or exposed by, narratives on identity,
adolescence, and the ghostly in Singapore.</p>
<p>Michael Lee is an artist, curator and publisher, whose works focus on
urban memory and fiction, with an emphasis on their contexts and issues
of loss.</p>

<h6>Jeremy Sharma<br>Work in Progress for the Outliers, 2014-2015</h6>
<h3><strong>Outliers</strong> | by Jeremy Sharma</h3>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Level 8, Promenade, National Library Building</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In the installation Outliers by Jeremy Sharma, are four white polystyrene
blocks with undulating surfaces that capture the signals of dying stars
(pulsars) in material form. Sharma, with the help of a pulsar scientist,
has been collecting and categorising the radiographic data of selected
pulsars. His work contemplates the profound space-time distance the signals
of dying stars travel to communicate their death throes.</p>
<p>Jeremy Sharma instigates investigative processes to inform the formal
expressions of his painterly and sculptural practice.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>Asia, particularly Southeast Asia, had a strong hold over the imaginations
of early Europeans as a source of gold, spices and all things exotic. Land
of Gold and Spices presents a fascinating look at how Southeast Asia was
perceived, conceived of and mapped by the Europeans from the 15th to the
early 19th centuries.</p>
<p>The maps featured in this exhibition are from the National Library, Singapore’s
rare maps collection and tell stories of the European presence in the region.
The exhibition features printed and hand-drawn maps as well as sailing
instructions that point to Singapore’s early history before the arrival
of the British in 1819. On special loan from European libraries are rare
maps, such as indigenous Southeast Asian maps, on display for the very
first time in Singapore.</p>

<h6>Charles Lim<br>Sea Safe (2014)</h6>
<h3><strong>SEA STATE 8 SEABOOK</strong> | An Art Project by Charles Lim</h3>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Level 11, Lee Kong Chian Reference Library, National Library Building</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Part of the SEA STATE series, <strong>SEABOOK</strong> follows Charles Lim’s
solo-exhibition, “In Search of Raffles’ Light” (2013) held at the NUS Museum.
SEABOOK is conceived by the artist, as a site for the accumulation of archival
materials, anecdotes and memories that unravels Singapore’s relationship
with the sea. Developed with the librarians from the National Library,
the project attempts to highlight the range of primary resources available
on the sea from the colonial and post-colonial periods. In effect, SEABOOK
aspires to be the most extensive cultural study of Singapore’s troubled
relationship with the sea.</p>
<p>Charles Lim will represent Singapore in the 2015 Venice Biennale. He has
a close relationship with the sea, being a former national sailor and having
represented Singapore in the 1996 Olympics.</p>
<p>Jointly organised by the National Library, Singapore and NUS Museum.</p>
