<p>Centenary Day took place on 6 February 1919 and marked Singapore’s hundredth
year as a colonial port-settlement. It was celebrated as a public holiday
filled with official festivities and fanfare. This display features photographs
and publications produced for the occasion. These materials not only capture
the day’s events, but also reveal how people in Singapore took part in
the commemoration and spectacle of empire.</p>
