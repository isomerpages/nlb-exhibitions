<h3 style="margin-top: 10px;"><em>Design Drawing for Staircases at Robert's Barrack, Changi</em></h3>

<p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">Stanley Warren<br>1942 – 1945<br>Stanley Warren collection, National Archives of Singapore</p>

<p>This is one of Stanley Warren's mural designs completed during his internment. To distract himself from the distress of being held against his will, he focused on his fascination with the rural landscapes in Singapore. He composed this idealised image of villagers surrounded by tropical plants, a buffalo and two monkeys — motifs common in Southeast Asia. The clear bold outlines used in his drawing reflected influences from his pre-war career as a movie billboard artist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">Stanley Warren<br>1942<br>Stanley Warren collection, National Archives of Singapore</p>

<p>This drawing depicts exhausted troops arriving at the Sime Road Transit Camp from Southern Johore in 1942, as they retreated from the advancing Japanese army. A trained artist, Stanley Warren enlisted in the army in January 1940. The Japanese invasion of Malaya brought him to the region two years later. As an observation post assistant, he was deployed to the precarious frontlines to record the situation on the ground.</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 10px;"><em>Internees Preparing Programme Posters and Putting Up a Musical</em></h3>

<p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">W. R. M. Haxworth<br>1942<br>W. R. M. Haxworth collection, National Archives of Singapore</p>

<p>Not all of Haxworth's drawings portray heavy subject matters about life as wartime internees. This colourful artwork, for instance, is one of the many examples by Haxworth that portrays a more light-hearted side of life in internment camp.  It depicts the preparation of programme posters that promoted a musical put up by internees. This drawing demonstrates the resourcefulness and positive attitude displayed by fellow internees amid the harsh living conditions.</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 10px;"><em>Letters of the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce on the Recovery of Remains of Victims Who Died in Operation Sook Ching</em></h3>

<p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">Singapore: 1962<br>Donated by Singapore Lam Ann Association. Collection of the National Library of Singapore</p>

<p>Following the discovery of mass war graves in Siglap in 1962, Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce (SCCC) undertook the responsibility of excavating and interring of the remains of victims who were massacred during the Japanese Occupation. Displayed here are two letters on the recovery operations by the SCCC. The letter on the left, addressed to the Prime Minister's Office, provided an update on the recovery process and the location of the burial sites. The letter on the right was sent in by a member of the public whose father and uncle were shot to death by Japanese soldiers. It informed the SCCC of a possible burial site at Upper Thomson Road on grounds that belong to present-day Singapore Island Country Club.</p>
