Come and explore what life was like in Singapore from the colonial era to the 1960s. Join us for this interactive programme set against the backdrop of Singapore’s early shopping scene.

Families will engage in hands-on activities to help their children understand the power of advertisements and strategies used to promote products and services. Facilitated by librarians, these fun and interactive sessions are opportunities for families to come together to solve puzzles as well as share experiences of what life in Singapore used to be like.
