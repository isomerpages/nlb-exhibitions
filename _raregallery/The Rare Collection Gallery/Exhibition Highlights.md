<h3><em>The Substance of Our Saviour's Sermon on the Mount Contained in the 5th, 6th &amp; c.7th Chapters of the Gospel According to St. Matthew</em></h3>
<p>Singapore: Printed by the S. C. Mission Press, 1829&nbsp;</p>
<p>Collection of National Library, Singapore&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>This booklet, one of 500 copies printed in 1829, is the oldest item featured
in the display. It is a Malay translation of the Sermon on the Mount, one
of the most significant and well-known teachings of Jesus from the Gospel
of Matthew in the Bible. The printing and distribution of religious literature
in local languages was an important part of missionary work in the region.
This title was likely translated by Danish missionary Claudius Henry Thomsen
from the London Missionary Society, as he had translated the Gospel of
Matthew in 1821 under the tutelage of his Malay teacher, Munshi Abdullah
Abdul Kadir, in Melaka. Thomsen is credited for establishing the first
printing press in Singapore, the Mission Press, in 1823.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>This drawing depicts exhausted troops arriving at the Sime Road Transit
Camp from Southern Johore in 1942, as they retreated from the advancing
Japanese army. A trained artist, Stanley Warren enlisted in the army in
January 1940. The Japanese invasion of Malaya brought him to the region
two years later. As an observation post assistant, he was deployed to the
precarious frontlines to record the situation on the ground.</p>

<h3><em>Internees Preparing Programme Posters and Putting Up a Musical</em></h3>
<p>W. R. M. Haxworth
<br>1942
<br>W. R. M. Haxworth collection, National Archives of Singapore</p>
<p>Not all of Haxworth's drawings portray heavy subject matters about life
as wartime internees. This colourful artwork, for instance, is one of the
many examples by Haxworth that portrays a more light-hearted side of life
in internment camp. It depicts the preparation of programme posters that
promoted a musical put up by internees. This drawing demonstrates the resourcefulness
and positive attitude displayed by fellow internees amid the harsh living
conditions.</p>

<h3><em>Letters of the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce on the Recovery of Remains of Victims Who Died in Operation Sook Ching</em></h3>
<p>Singapore: 1962
<br>Donated by Singapore Lam Ann Association. Collection of the National Library
of Singapore</p>
<p>Following the discovery of mass war graves in Siglap in 1962, Singapore
Chinese Chamber of Commerce (SCCC) undertook the responsibility of excavating
and interring of the remains of victims who were massacred during the Japanese
Occupation. Displayed here are two letters on the recovery operations by
the SCCC. The letter on the left, addressed to the Prime Minister's Office,
provided an update on the recovery process and the location of the burial
sites. The letter on the right was sent in by a member of the public whose
father and uncle were shot to death by Japanese soldiers. It informed the
SCCC of a possible burial site at Upper Thomson Road on grounds that belong
to present-day Singapore Island Country Club.</p>
