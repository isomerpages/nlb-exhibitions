#### Cartography at National Geographic: From Crow Quill Pen to Computer

__Thursday, 5 Mar, 7:00pm – 8:30pm &#124; Possibility Room, Level 5 &#124; Speaker: Mr Juan José Valdés__

Technology has modified the way maps have been traditionally researched, designed and edited. This is nowhere more evident than at the National Geographic Society, with its cartographic tradition spanning over 100 years; their cartographers have now embraced the fast-paced digital world of map-making. Speaking live from Washington DC via web broadcast, Mr Juan José Valdés, official geographer of the National Geographic Society, addresses the society’s significant milestones and their impact on its maps and map products.
